# Code of Conduct

All lab members, including visitors and remote researchers, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everyone in the lab. We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. (However, as we work on biological questions, work-related discussions of topics that include animal reproduction are appropriate.)

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Grace Smith-Vidaurre immediately. If Grace is the cause of your concern and you need to seek official resources, then please contact the [Office of the University Ombudsperson at Michigan State University](https://ombud.msu.edu/) (email: ombud@msu.edu, phone: (517) 353-8830). This office provides a confidential and impartial space for discussing issues or conflicts.
