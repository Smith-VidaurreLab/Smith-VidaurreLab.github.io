## Welcome

Welcome to the lab handbook for the Smith-Vidaurre Lab. Dr. Grace Smith-Vidaurre is the head of the lab. At any point in time, other members of the Smith-Vidaurre Lab may include postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, research assistants or technicians, undergraduate students, and visiting scientists. This handbook is intended to be a resource for all current members of the lab, as well as prospective researchers and students who are interested in joining the lab. As you read this handbook, you'll find information about general expectations for lab members, as well as information about how the lab operates. Everyone who joins the lab is expected to commit to the general guidelines outlined here, which serve as a contract for how the research team will work together.

**We commit to a shared goal of conducting creative, rigorous, and accessible science**. In order to meet this goal, we are dedicated to building and maintaining an inclusive lab culture that supports scientists from diverse backgrounds with varied interests and career goals. As a lab, we commit to sustaining an anti-racist working culture and a safe space for members of the queer community.

Our lab is focused on three primary research areas:

- We study how animals use socially learned vocalizations, with a particular focus on information encoding about individual identity and social affiliations. This work is largely empirical research with parrots and songbirds, but also leverages simulation and modeling approaches.

- We work on how animals' early-life environments can shape the learned vocalizations that they produce as adults, as well as the brain regions necessary for learned vocal production.

- The lab integrates data science approaches across these lines of research. We develop and test computational pipelines for collecting and analyzing empirical or simulated datasets. We engage in open-access methods development and are committed to disseminating data science skills to lab members, as well as students in the local and broader STEM community.

### Why do we do the science that we do?

The lab works on basic science that is primarily focused on animal communication and behavior. Our primary research is not applied science, which means that we do not study direct applications of animal communication and behavior for the conservation or management of animal populations in captivity or the wild. 

However, this does not mean that our science has less impact or is less important. Our research on animal communication and behavior has direct connections to human language, and is a compelling way for the broader public to learn more about animals, in the spirit of fostering more curiosity and respect for the natural world around us. Contributing to the public's perception of animals is an important way to contribute to how individuals and institutions change their behavior and prioritize resources for conservation purposes and community engagement with the natural world. The lab is committed to disseminating our research to the public in order to broaden the impact of our research.

Our research also creates rich opportunities for training and teaching the next generation of biologists and data scientists at different career stages. Scientists and students who work on research in our lab will leave with a deeper understanding of the scientific process, the exciting questions that drive the lab's research, and how applying data science approaches to address these biological questions facilitates creative and rigorous research. Students in the local community who take classes taught by lab members, including Dr. Smith-Vidaurre, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students, will also receive scientific and quantitative training that is important for different careers. This ability to reach many students in the community through research training and teaching is an exciting component of traditional academic careers.

## Environment and Expectations

### Lab Environment

In the Smith-Vidaurre Lab, we are committed to conducting high-quality science as well as helping each other to grow as scientists. In addition to creating an inclusive lab culture, our intent is also to maintain a collaborative and communicative environment for all lab members. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions about the science that we do and read about. In this lab, we expect everyone to make mistakes, and we also expect everyone to own up to and address their mistakes so as to learn from them. Another important aspect of growing as a scientist is learning how to respond when someone disagrees with you, so we also encourage lab members to challenge someone in constructive ways when you do not agree.

In order to build and maintain our intended lab environment, all Smith-Vidaurre Lab members, including visitors and remote researchers, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all lab members to help ensure a safe environment for everyone in the lab. We expect lab members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

### Code of Conduct

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. However, as we work on biological questions, work-related discussions of topics that include animal reproduction are appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Grace Smith-Vidaurre immediately. If Dr. Smith-Vidaurre is the cause of your concern and you need to seek official resources, then please contact the [Office of the University Ombudsperson at Michigan State University](https://ombud.msu.edu/) (email: ombud@msu.edu, phone: (517) 353-8830). This office provides a confidential and impartial space for discussing issues or conflicts.

### Lab Meetings

Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will generally be expected to participate in all lab meetings, unless discussed otherwise with Dr. Smith-Vidaurre. Lab members working remotely are expected to join these meetings via Zoom. Undergraduate students will be encouraged to attend lab meetings as their class schedule permits, and to join other meetings as they are able. 

These meetings will occur with different frequencies, with the purpose of providing regular feedback necessary for research activities, as well as professional development, and building an inclusive and equitable lab culture:

- **Biweekly Lab Meetings** (1.5 hours): These meetings will typically be focused around discussing research updates from each lab member and their planned activities for the next two weeks. We will also periodically use these lab meetings to discuss research papers published by other groups, or for professional development activities for the lab.

- **Monthly Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Meetings** (1.5 hours): This monthly meeting will be dedicated to discussing how we can continue to build and sustain an anti-racist lab and a safe space for queer scientists. We will also discuss how we can contribute to making the lab, our departmental community, and the broader scientific community more diverse, equitable, and just spaces. These meetings will be particularly focused on broadening lab members' understanding of how we can take action against systemic oppression in academia, and encouraging lab members to engage in their own process of self-education about the many barriers that arise from such oppression.

- **Weekly Writing Group** (2 hours): We will meet each week for focused writing time as a team. Each lab member will bring one or multiple writing projects* that require progress. At the beginning of each meeting, we will each state the project that we are working on and our goal for the current writing session (15 minutes). Everyone will work on their writing project(s) without interrupting others for ~1.5 hours, and then we will catch up about writing progress and obstacles in the last 15 minutes. Depending on the lab's preferences, visitors from other labs at MSU may be invited to join us for this writing group.

- **Weekly Science Afternoon** (1 hour, Fridays): Each week we will dedicate time to a casual meeting to work on projects or activities as a team. These meetings can include brainstorming new collaborative projects, debugging code, discussing a statistical analysis that someone wants to learn, or providing feedback on lab members' figures in preparation for publication, among other topics. Visitors from other labs at MSU or other institutions can be invited to join us from time to time.  

- **Practice Presentations** (scheduled as needed): Practicing presentations for conferences, invited seminars, or academic job interviews is critically important for growing as a scientist. Practicing your presentation in front of your lab members is an excellent way to receive invaluable constructive feedback that can help improve the content and delivery of your presentation. All lab members who present at conferences are expected to schedule practice presentations with the lab at least a week prior to the conference itself, and to incorporate the lab's feedback into the final version of their presentation. Postdoctoral researchers who want constructive feedback on their job talk(s) are encouraged to practice their talk with the lab as well. As a general rule of thumb, we will allocate 45 minutes of feedback for presentations that are 15 - 50 minutes, and 30 minutes of feedback for presentations under 15 minutes (posters and lightning talks).

\* *Writing projects will vary across members of the lab. Depending on your career stage, a writing project could consist of a manuscript, a grant proposal, a thesis proposal, standard operating protocols for the lab, or documentation of open-access software. For all lab members, writing tasks for these weekly writing groups will vary depending on the type and stage of your project. For instance, if you are contributing to a collaborative manuscript in the lab, a good writing task could be to write up the methods that you used to collect or analyze data, or to write a first draft of the introduction. If you are not contributing to a manuscript yet, you can instead work on writing up a standardized operating protocol for the experiments or tasks you are working on in the lab, or reading a paper and writing a short summary of the paper in an annotated bibliography.*

### Smith-Vidaurre Mentoring Approach (or what you can expect from me)

My approach to mentorship is to consider each member of the lab a unique individual with their own learning trajectory and career goals. Everyone in the lab will have direct access to mentorship from me in individual or group meetings, but the frequency of these meetings will depend on your career stage. All lab members will also have opportunities to receive mentorship from and provide mentorship to other researchers in the lab.

Generally, I aim to meet with postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research assistants once a week for individual meetings. These meetings will be 30 minutes long to facilitate a quick discussion of research progress and obstacles as well as short and long-term goals. Individual meeting times can be shortened or extended depending on a researcher's needs and my own availability. Undergraduate lab members will work directly with a postdoctoral, graduate student, research assistant, or senior undergraduate mentor. Undergraduate students will meet weekly with their direct mentor. I will meet with lab mentors and their undergraduate mentee(s) at least 3 times each semester (or more frequently as needed) for additional research supervision.

Lab members can expect mentorship from me on their science, ranging from brainstorming of new ideas to preparing and submitting manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The mentorship that I will provide lab members will also include constructive feedback on grant proposals and presentations, and regular discussion about how I can support you to achieve your career goals. My goal is to support lab members who are interested in diverse careers inside or outside of academia. As I have more experience with academic careers, I can provide direct feedback and tips for lab members interested in traditional and alternative academic careers. However, I aim to also connect lab members to colleagues in my network with non-academic jobs, and can also support lab members pursue internal and external opportunities to learn more about non-academic jobs.

I will work with each member of the lab to set up short and long-term goals at the beginning of each semester.

#### Letters of recommendation

All members of the lab who are pursuing the next steps of their career should use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWotlHg55X_p-6h8bIoqtsvSqlOCiFwW0QOJXdorvza_uR7A/viewform?usp=sf_link) to request letters of recommendation from me.

Given my limited time as a faculty member, I cannot write recommendation letters less than 2 weeks before a given letter is due. Please ensure that you request letters of recommendation well ahead of this 2 week deadline. The form above is designed to collect the information that I will need to write a strong letter of recommendation. After filling out this form the first time, there are several questions that you do not need to fill out for subsequent requests (for instance, information about when we first met).

My ability to write a strong recommendation letter is contingent on your performance, progress, and behavior in the lab. If I feel that I cannot write you a strong letter, then I reserve the right to decline to write you a letter at all.

### General Research Expectations

In the Smith-Vidaurre Lab, we engage in research that relies on captive animal experiments and regular animal care, wet lab work, and computational approaches to collect, process, and analyze data. I expect all lab members to fully engage in learning the approaches and methods necessary to conduct research in the lab, ranging from caring for captive songbirds on campus, to assembling and deploying electronics technology for data collection, to learning basic molecular biology protocols as well as basic programming and data analysis skills.

#### Computing skills and GitHub

As the lab works on computational analyses of different types of behavioral, molecular, or simulated datasets, everyone in the lab will be expected to become competent in computing skills that include R, bash, Python, and GitHub. For instance, common tasks that you should be able to accomplish include installing R and using RStudio to write/save scripts, as well as accessing directories and files from a bash shell. A common pipeline that you should use regularly is to use GitHub (through Git on the command line or RStudio, or through GitHub Desktop) to synchronize local and remote repositories of your different coding and writing projects.

**Everyone in the lab will be expected to learn how to use GitHub for version control and project management**, and to regularly use GitHub across their different projects. Each mentor leading a project in the lab will be responsible for setting up and maintaining a GitHub repository(ies) and project management structure for their research team. GitHub is a valuable tool for coordinating collaborative research, tracking changes to files over time by different team members, and providing cloud backups of files. The skills that you learn from using GitHub are also highly transferrable to other careers, particularly in data science. Lab members will be expected to set up and maintain GitHub repositories for projects that include different amounts of writing and coding, spanning from grant proposals (typically writing only) to manuscripts (writing and code) to software development (primarily code but also documentation).

#### Lab Notebooks

**Lab notebooks are another requirement for all lab members**. Everyone who is working on computational research in the lab is required to maintain an electronic lab notebook that they update in *real time*. See this tutorial for how to create an [electronic lab notebook](https://sr320.github.io/course-fish521-2023/lectures/week_07/lec_06b_websites.html). Lab members who are conducting wet lab work will be required to keep a physical lab notebook, and to regularly update their electronic lab notebook with photographs of the physical notebook as well. Across lab notebooks, each lab member should document what they have done in a manner such that someone else could replicate the work you have done.

The standard practice in the lab will be to document your daily activities. If your day was focused on reading papers, document the titles of the papers that you read (and keep an annotated bibliography in a separate document). If your day was focused on scanning the Internet to troubleshoot code or hardware issues, document the websites that you visited and your troubleshooting steps. All lab notebooks need to have an immediate backup, which you can create by updating a text file on your computer that you push to GitHub each day, among other options. Each lab notebook needs to have entries that are organized by date in reverse chronological order.

#### Writing

**Building and maintaining a regular writing habit** is another research expectation across lab members. Writing is critical for doing science, for communicating our ideas and results to our colleagues and the broader public, as well as obtaining the funding necessary to do the science itself. As scientists, we need to be writing every single day. Writing can take many different forms, and we will discuss writing productivity regularly as a lab. Each lab member will also be expected to seek peer feedback on writing products from at least 1 other lab member prior to requesting constructive feedback from Dr. Smith-Vidaurre.

#### Safety and Wellbeing

Both safety and wellbeing are fundamental for doing good science. All lab members must complete required safety training through MSU in a timely manner. I expect that lab members will avoid working alone as much as possible, particularly outside of typical working hours. In the spirit of growing as scientists and conducting creative and rigorous science, I encourage all lab members to regularly maintain their wellbeing and self-care routines in their lives outside of work. Lab members must take time to recharge and invest in their personal hobbies and priorities in order to become excellent scientists. 

Pushing yourself so hard that you regularly burn out and fail to make steady progress towards your goals, and/or begin to disappear from regular lab activities, is not considered good practice in the lab. This behavior will not be tolerated.

If you are in need of additional resources to manage stress, anxiety, or your general mental health, please reach out to the confidential counseling services offered by MSU: https://caps.msu.edu/ or the employee assistance program: https://eap.msu.edu/.

#### Artificial Intelligence

As a member of the lab, you need to learn how use generative artificial intelligence (AI) or other AI tools with a lot of careful thought and consideration. Lab members who want to use AI tools to scaffold their learning process must check in with Dr. Smith-Vidaurre before beginning to use these tools.

Using AI tools to replace any step of your work in the scientific process is not acceptable. However, it will be acceptable to use AI tools to scaffold your learning process, as long as you communicate your use of these tools with Dr. Smith-Vidaurre and demonstrate that you are using AI generated materials as a rough starting point, and modifying the generated materials using your own creative and critical thinking. Given privacy concerns, it is also not acceptable to upload any sensitive material from the lab, including data or drafts of manuscripts or grant proposals, to any AI interfaces.

#### Lab Communication

The lab will primarily communicate during in person lab meetings or individual meetings (remote members will attend via Zoom), as well as over email, and through creating or responding to issue postings on GitHub. In the future, the lab may begin to use other platforms for regular lab communication.

#### Lab Duties

Each lab member will have a rotating set of lab duties that they must complete in a timely manner. These lab duties are critically important for ensuring that the lab's work runs smoothly on a day to day basis, and each of us needs to contribute to these regular duties. Lab duties will typically be assigned at the start of the semester, and can include duties that range from maintaining the lab printer, cleaning the kitchen appliances or wet lab benches, tracking hazardous waste, chemicals, and safety training for lab members, reviewing lab members' code, among other duties. 


### Specific Expectations for Different Team Members

#### Graduate Students

Gradudate school is hard for many different reasons, and it is hard in a different way for each person. Completing a graduate degree can also be very rewarding, but you need to have your own motivations very clear in order to overcome the difficult periods. I expect that graduate students joining the lab have their own clear motivations for wanting to complete a graduate degree, beyond external expectations from your personal and professional networks. Completing a graduate degree is something that you commit to for yourself, and is not something that you undertake in order to satisfy another person (including me).

A PhD or Masters degree is a long-term undertaking in which you invest in your own learning process. In this learning process, you will constantly push the limits of your own knowledge as well as your existing technical skills. I expect graduate students to keep their minds open to constantly learning from every experience, whether it be learning a new statistical analysis in a class, watching a very boring seminar, remembering which paper includes a key conceptual idea, or receiving constructive criticism from myself or the lab. I expect graduate students to treat this learning process as building the foundation of your independent research program, meaning that you will be expected to think of, carry out, and defend your own independent research.

In addition to committing to this intensive learning process, you will also be asked to wear many different hats, which is an important part of academic jobs. As a graduate student, you will need to learn how to balance developing, carrying out, and funding your independent research projects with contributing to collaborative research (inside or outside of the lab), attending regular indivdiual and lab meetings to contribute to the lab's culture, mentor undergraduate students and/or research assistants, provide peer feedback to lab members on their writing products, keeping up with your regularly assigned lab duties, and also tracking/keeping up with your responsilbities for the classes that you teach, the classes that you take as a student, and your graduate degree requirements, and future career steps, among other responsibilities.

It is critical that graduate students in the lab learn how to manage their time and work effectively in order to avoid becoming overwhelmed and burning out. You need to invest time in your personal life, as well as time to recharge and keep up your self-care.

Graduate students are encouraged to regularly discuss their career goals with me so that I can sponsor you or connect you to opportunities for additional career development. For instance, graduate students interested in conducting postdoctoral research are encouraged to talk with me often during their last 2 years of their graduate program about how to find, consider, and pursue external postdoctoral research opportunities.

##### Performance expectations

As a graduate student, your performance will be evaluated by your thesis supervisor (Dr. Smith-Vidaurre) as well as your graduate committee. You need to make progress on your thesis research while also completing the minimum requirements for the graduate program to which you were accepted.

Your performance as a graduate student is tied to how quickly and how well you learn to manage your time. How you manage your time will also be conditional on the source of your stipend. Unless you have won a research fellowship, your stipends will likely come from working as a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) or graduate research assistant (GA). Graduate student stipends will vary depending on the source of the funding, and the responsibilities associated with these positions will vary as well. Regardless of the source of your stipend, you will be expected to meet performance expectations and research goals each semester. If your GTA or GA responsibilities are taking up too much time, then you need to inform Dr. Smith-Vidaurre immediately.

##### Research Credits and Classes

Each graduate student will be responsible for tracking their graduate degree requirements and regularly discussing their class and research credit plan with Dr. Smith-Vidaurre. Generally, newer graduate students will have a heavier class load than graduate students further along in their careers, who will primarily sign up for dissertation research credits.

#### Postdoctoral Researchers

I am interested in supporting postdoctoral researchers in my lab through grants as well as competitive fellowships to conduct independent research. Generally, I expect postdocs supported on grants to spend their time leading writing and analysis, as well as the presentation and manuscript preparation activities necessary to communicate and publish the lab's core research. For postdocs who join the lab with independent funding, I expect you to spend time in similar ways (but on your independent research) while also picking up new skills from working in the lab. 

I expect all postdocs to work closely with me to prepare manuscript drafts for the lab's core research or your independent research conducted in collaboration with the lab. We need to discuss authorship contributions and roles early and often, as well as what parts of the research that you conduct in the lab should stay in the lab after you leave, and what parts of the research you can take with you. I also expect all postdocs in the lab to contribute to mentoring lab members at different career stages, including providing peer feedback on writing products and presentations, providing guidance on data collection or analysis given your own expertise, and providing feedback related to professional development, such as discussing your own career path with the lab. When you contribute to mentoring students in the lab who prepare manuscripts for publication, we also need to discuss authorship expectations early and often. 

Postdocs joining the lab should discuss research performance and career development expectations with me early and often. For postdoctoral researchers who are interested in academic careers, I can provide constructive feedback on academic job applications and oppportunities to practice job talks. Postdocs interested in traditional academic careers are also encouraged to regularly discuss how I can support them to continue developing their independent research programs. For postdocs who are more interested in teaching-intensive careers or non-academic careers, I am committed to connecting you to resources at MUSU and/or colleagues in my network who may be available for informational interviews. I am also open to postdocs taking time to pursue workshops or training opportunities towards their career goals.

#### Research Assistants

Research assistants in the lab will be expected to contribute to leading core research projects in the lab, helping the lab set up equipment, computational pipelines, standard operating protocols, and regular animal care duties to support new lines of research. Research assistants will also be expected to mentor and work with undergraduate students who are engaged in research and/or animal care, and helping graduate students who are leading their own research projects.

I encourage research assistants to regularly discuss their career goals with me so that I can connect you to opportunities for additional career development. Research assistants interested in graduate programs are encouraged to discuss their interests with me, so that we can talk about the possibility of joining the lab as a graduate student, or identifying potential graduate mentors and applying to graduate programs at other institutions.

#### Undergraduate Students

Undergraduate students can join the lab to work on research projects or animal care under the supervision of a research assistant or a graduate student. Undergraduate students who join the lab must be motivated and have sufficient time in their schedules to commit to at least 9 hours of work in the lab each week for at least a year. Undergraduates will be required to read and sign a contract prior to beginning their work in the lab.  

Undergraduate students interested in graduate programs are encouraged to discuss their interests with their direct supervisor and Dr. Smith-Vidaurre. We can discuss the possibility of joining the lab as a graduate student, or identifying potential graduate mentors and applying to graduate programs at other institutions.
