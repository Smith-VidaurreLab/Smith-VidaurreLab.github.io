## Welcome

Welcome to the lab handbook for the Smith-Vidaurre Lab. Dr. Grace Smith-Vidaurre is the head of the lab. At any point in time, other members of the Smith-Vidaurre Lab may include postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, research assistants or technicians, undergraduate students, and visiting scientists. This handbook is intended to be a resource for all current members of the lab, as well as prospective researchers and students who are interested in joining the lab. As you read this handbook, you'll find information about general expectations for lab members, as well as information about how the lab operates. Everyone who joins the lab is expected to commit to the general guidelines outlined here, which serve as a contract for how the research team will work together.

**We commit to a shared goal of conducting creative, rigorous, and accessible science**. In order to meet this goal, we are dedicated to building and maintaining an inclusive lab culture that supports scientists from diverse backgrounds with varied interests and career goals. As a lab, we commit to sustaining an anti-racist working culture and a safe space for members of the queer community.

Our lab is focused on three primary research areas:

- We study how animals use socially learned vocalizations, with a particular focus on information encoding about individual identity and social affiliations. This work is largely empirical research with parrots and songbirds, but also leverages simulation and modeling approaches.

- We work on how animals' early-life environments can shape the learned vocalizations that they produce as adults, as well as the brain regions necessary for learned vocal production.

- The lab integrates a data science perspective across these lines of research. We develop and test computational pipelines for collecting and analyzing empirical or simulated datasets. We engage in open-access methods development and are committed to disseminating data science skills to lab members, as well as students in the local and broader STEM community


## Environment and Expectations

### Lab Environment

In the Smith-Vidaurre Lab, we are committed to conducting high-quality science as well as helping each other to grow as scientists. In addition to creating an inclusive lab culture, our intent is also to maintain a collaborative and communicative environment for all lab members. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions about the science that we do and read about. In this lab, we expect everyone to make mistakes, and we also expect everyone to own up to and address their mistakes so as to learn from them. Another important aspect of growing as a scientist is learning how to respond when someone disagrees with you, so we also encourage lab members to challenge someone in constructive ways when you do not agree.

In order to build and maintain our intended lab environment, all Smith-Vidaurre Lab members, including visitors and remote researchers, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all lab members to help ensure a safe environment for everyone in the lab. We expect lab members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

### Code of Conduct

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. However, as we work on biological questions, work-related discussions of topics that include animal reproduction are appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Grace Smith-Vidaurre immediately. If Dr. Smith-Vidaurre is the cause of your concern and you need to seek official resources, then please contact the [Office of the University Ombudsperson at Michigan State University](https://ombud.msu.edu/) (email: ombud@msu.edu, phone: (517) 353-8830). This office provides a confidential and impartial space for discussing issues or conflicts.

### Lab Meetings

Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will generally be expected to participate in all lab meetings, unless discussed otherwise with Dr. Smith-Vidaurre. Lab members working remotely are expected to join these meetings via Zoom. Undergraduate students will be encouraged to attend lab meetings as their class schedule permits, and to join other meetings as they are able. 

These meetings will occur with different frequencies, with the purpose of providing regular feedback necessary for research activities, as well as professional development, and building an inclusive and equitable lab culture:

- **Biweekly Lab Meetings** (1.5 hours): These meetings will typically be focused around discussing research updates from each lab member and their planned activities for the next two weeks. We will also periodically use these lab meetings to discuss research papers published by other groups, or for professional development activities for the lab.

- **Monthly Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Meetings** (1.5 hours): This monthly meeting will be dedicated to discussing how we can continue to build and sustain an anti-racist lab and a safe space for queer scientists. We will also discuss how we can contribute to making the lab, our departmental community, and the broader scientific community more diverse, equitable, and just spaces. These meetings will be particularly focused on broadening lab members' understanding of how we can take action against systemic oppression in academia, and encouraging lab members to engage in their own process of self-education about the many barriers that arise from such oppression.

- **Weekly Writing Group** (2 hours): We will meet each week for focused writing time as a team. Each lab member will bring one or multiple writing projects that require progress. At the beginning of each meeting, we will each state the project that we are working on and our goal for the current writing session (15 minutes). Everyone will work on their writing project(s) without interrupting others for ~1.5 hours, and then we will catch up about writing progress and obstacles in the last 15 minutes. 

- **Weekly Science Afternoon** (1 hour, Fridays): Each week we will dedicate time to a casual meeting to work on projects as a team. These meetings can include brainstorming new collaborative projects, debugging code, discussing a statistical analysis that someone wants to learn, providing feedback on lab members' figures in preparation for publication, among other topics.

- **Practice Presentations** (scheduled as needed): Practicing presentations for conferences, invited seminars, or academic job interviews is critically important for growing as a scientist. Practicing your presentation in front of your lab members is an excellent way to receive invaluable constructive feedback that can help improve the content and delivery of your presentation. All lab members who present at conferences are expected to schedule practice presentations with the lab at least a week prior to the conference itself, and to incorporate the lab's feedback into the final version of their presentation. Postdoctoral researchers who want constructive feedback on their job talk(s) are encouraged to practice their talk with the lab as well. As a general rule of thumb, we will allocate 45 minutes of feedback for presentations that are 15 - 50 minutes, and 30 minutes of feedback for presentations under 15 minutes (posters and lightning talks).



### Smith-Vidaurre Mentoring Approach

Everyone will have opportunities for mentorship and to receive mentorship. Career development. Expectations on both sides

### Expectations for Research Team Personnel
